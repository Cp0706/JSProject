## Task 1: Movie count per language
### Output format: 
- en: 10
- es: 2
- ...

### Hints
1. Write code in `run()` method and feel free to add additional methods.
2. Use a `Map`, movie property `originalLanguage` as key and 
keep adding to the count as value.

## Task 2: Show language name and count
### Output format: 
- English (English): 10
- Spanish (Español): 2

### Hints
1. You will need to use `data.languages` array - see at the bottom of 
the `movies.js` file. One of the language objects in the array is as follows:
~~~
{
    "iso_639_1": "hi",
    "english_name": "Hindi",
    "name": "हिन्दी"
}
~~~
2. You will need to iterate data.languages array and populate another
Map with key as language code and value of language object. 
3. When displaying final output, lookup language info from the new Map
and use the returned value to show the output. 

## Task 3: Show the output in HTML Table on the browser
### Hints: 
1. Use learning from the previous exercise.
2. Use semantic ui HTML table formatting classes. See details here: 
https://semantic-ui.com/collections/table.html - clicking on <> will show code. 

## Task 4 (Optional): Show output sorted by movie count
### Hints: 
1. It's easier than you think it is - just 2-3 lines of code. 
2. Check JS Array Sorting documentation on MDN.

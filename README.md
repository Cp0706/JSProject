## Overview
The Movie App is a user-friendly web application designed to enhance the movie browsing experience. Users can effortlessly discover tailored movie recommendations by leveraging a variety of filters, including language, decade, and genre.

## Setup
### Project Configuration
1. Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/Cp0706/JSProject` in a directory of your choice. This creates the `Movies-Project-JS` directory with the repository contents.
2. Open the project in VS Code using `File > Open Folder` (Windows) or `File > Open` (Mac) and select the `JSProject` folder.

## Running the Project
1. Execute command `npm start` on terminal window. This will start the `lite-server` on port 3000 and open a new tab on your default browser to show the project home - index.html. 
2. The server automatically watches for changes in any html, JavaScript, and CSS files and automatically refreshes the browser tab. This allows you a seamless development experience.
